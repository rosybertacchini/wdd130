      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        <p>ERP Implementation - project 1</p>
        <p>
I had the privilege to participate in the integration of Samsung's ERP system into my current company, an experience that provided me with a comprehensive understanding of ERP systems, including their features, capabilities, and configuration options. 
The implementation involved significant changes to organizational processes and structures. Managing these changes effectively and working together towards a common goal certainly is the foundation of success.

      <p>

As an integral member of the IT team, I have actively contributed to the supervision and development of two dedicated IT rooms, situated within the newly constructed buildings. This invaluable opportunity has enabled me to acquire a diverse set of skills and extensive knowledge in the field. I learned how important is as well of implementing efficient air conditioning solutions to maintain optimal temperature and humidity levels within the IT rooms. I also learned how to deploy reliable uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, safeguarding against potential power outages and ensuring uninterrupted operation of critical equipment. 
Another crucial aspect of this project involved establishing and implementing robust structured cabling infrastructure. Also, I recognized the importance of physical security measures for protecting our valuable assets.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>  
        Beyond my professional life, I have developed a deep passion for hydroponic farming, where I grow food using in my back yard. This method allows me to cultivate a variety of plants in a controlled environment, optimizing resources and minimizing waste. It's truly fascinating to witness the plants thriving without soil, as I experiment with different nutrient solutions and lighting setups to maximize their growth potential.  Simultaneously, I am dedicated to improving my English language skills. I believe that effective communication is crucial for personal and professional growth. I eagerly engage in various activities to expand my vocabulary. Reading books, watching movies, and participating in language exchange programs have been invaluable in broadening my understanding of the English language. Moreover, I have a keen interest in immersing myself in American culture and understanding the principles of "Free Enterprise”.
