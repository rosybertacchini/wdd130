          <p>
            I had the privilege to participate in the integration of Samsung's
            ERP system into my current company, an experience that provided me
            with a comprehensive understanding of ERP systems, including their
            features, capabilities, and configuration options. The
            implementation involved significant changes to organizational
            processes and structures. Managing these changes effectively and
            working together towards a common goal certainly is the foundation
            of success.

          <p>
            In the past few years, my company has achieved significant growth,
            expanding our operations and establishing two new facilities. . As
            an integral member of the IT team, I have actively contributed to
            the supervision and development of two dedicated IT rooms, situated
            within the newly constructed buildings. This invaluable opportunity
            has enabled me to acquire a diverse set of skills and extensive
            knowledge in the field. I learned how important is as well of
            implementing efficient air conditioning solutions to maintain
            optimal temperature and humidity levels within the IT rooms. I also
            learned how to deploy reliable uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
            systems, safeguarding against potential power outages and ensuring
            uninterrupted operation of critical equipment. Another crucial
            aspect of this project involved establishing and implementing robust
            structured cabling infrastructure. Also, I recognized the importance
            of physical security measures for protecting our valuable assets.
